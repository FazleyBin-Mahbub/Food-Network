            I’ve been on a salad with dinner kick recently. Trying to add more
            fruits and veggies to our evening meals, salads are an obvious
            choice. I’ve learned in life there are salads and there are salads.
            Besides the lettuce, it all comes down to having the best salad
            topping combinations…

            The cornmeal-fried squid was the sort of salty that friolates
            tonsils and leaves your lips with chemical burns. It was the sort of

            Be forewarned, Whitehall’s butter is more than just butter. It’s
            butter blended with pork drippings and served with thick slices of
            housebaked bread. You might not make it past the bread course.
